Smart AI Notes is an intelligent note-taking app that solves mathematical and graphical questions in real-time. Just write your question or problem, and the system will detect and solve it, providing the answer with beautifully rendered mathematical expressions. The project is built using **Next.js** for both frontend and backend, and leverages the **Gemini model** to provide answers. Math rendering is handled by **MathJax**.

## ðŸš€ Live Demo
You can try out the live app here: [Smart AI Notes](https://smart-ai-notes.vercel.app/)

## ðŸ“¹ Demo Video
You can find demo video at [Youtube](https://youtu.be/jN0tGNHqr6w).

## Features
